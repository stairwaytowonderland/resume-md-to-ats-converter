# Resume Markdown ➜ ATS-friendly Document ⭐

A tool to [convert your Markdown resume or cv into an ATS-friendly Word document](#usage-) that looks clean and professional while preserving your carefully crafted content. 🚀



## Overview 📚

This project allows you to maintain your resume in an easily editable Markdown format, then convert it to an ATS (Applicant Tracking System) optimized Word document with proper formatting for better parsing by job application systems.

🧬 **Your Markdown resume *must* use the same ("*Resume Markdown*") format as the [sample template](./sample/template/sample.md)** 🧬

*(see the [Sample Template](#sample-template-%EF%B8%8F) section for more details)*



## Key Features ⚡️

- Proper formatting of sections (contact, experience, education, etc.)
- Maintains hierarchy of job titles, companies, and dates
- Properly formats projects, skills, and responsibilities
- Creates an ATS-friendly document that parses well in applicant tracking systems
- [API](#-api-usage-) for the *no-setup* approach

> [!NOTE]
> *There are more files and directories in the project than what's shown above; the above just lists any files (and directories) that would be relevant to a typical user.*



## Sample Template 🖼️

A [sample Markdown resume](./sample/template/sample.md) (`sample/template/sample.md`) is included in this project. You may copy or download it and use it as a *template* to create your own Markdown resume.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Any changes to `h2` heading text in your markdown file must be reflected in the corresponding `markdown_heading` values in the `resume_sections` configuration. See the [Resume Sections](#resume-sections-) section for more details.

You can [download the sample `.docx` document](./sample/template/output/sample.docx) (`sample/template/output/sample.docx`) and open it in *Microsoft Word* or *Google Docs* (or another application capable of viewing `.docx` files) to see how the sample Markdown file is rendered.

### Example Resume ⚛️

֎ **An *"ai"* generated real-world [example](./sample/example/example.md) (`sample/example/example.md`) is also included in this project** ֎

⬇️ You can [download the example `.docx` document](./sample/example/output/example.docx) (`sample/example/output/example.docx`) and open it in a compatible application to see how the sample Markdown file is rendered.

👀 You can [view the example pdf](./sample/example/output/example.pdf) directly in your browser, if your browser supports it (most do).



## Styling 🎨

The [resume_config.yaml](./src/resume_config.yaml) (`resume_config.yaml`) is used to control certain stylings. It can be customized to modify how the `.docx` looks, to a limited degree.

> [!TIP]
> **One reason you might want to modify this file for your own purpose, is the font name** 🔠 (see below)

By default, `Helvetica Neue` is used as the base font. Your system should be able to figure out a compatible replacement automatically. However if you prefer to control the fonts, you can change the `font_name` property values:

```yaml
document_styles:
  Normal:
    font_name: "Arial"
    # ...

  Title:
    font_name: "Arial"
    # ...
```



## Resume Sections 🚀

The converter maps Markdown headings to ATS-friendly Word document headings using the `ResumeSection` enum. The **Markdown headings are *case-insensitive***. The default mappings are:

| Markdown Heading (h2) | Word Document Heading |
|----------------------|----------------------|
| About | PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY |
| Top Skills | CORE SKILLS |
| Experience | PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE |
| Projects | PROJECTS |
| Linceces & Certifications | LICENSES & CERTIFICATIONS |
| Education | EDUCATION |
| Contact | CONTACT INFORMATION |

> [!Tip]
> If an `hr` (3 dashes, i.e. "---") is added immediately before a section (in your input `.md` file), that will put a page-break in the final document.

### Modifications 🦾

> [!NOTE]
> *Only applies if [running locally](#local-usage-), or you're [deployling](#development-) your own*

If you need to customize these mappings, you can modify the `resume_sections` configuration block in [`resume_config.yaml`](./src/resume_config.yaml). For example:

```yaml
resume_sections:
  about:
    markdown_heading: "About Me"  # Changed from "About"
    docx_heading: "PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY"
    add_space_before_h3: false
    add_space_before_h2: false
  skills:
    markdown_heading: "Core Skills"  # Changed from "Top Skills"
    docx_heading: "TECHNICAL EXPERTISE"  # Changed heading text
    add_space_before_h3: false
    add_space_before_h2: false
  # ... other sections
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Remember that any changes to the `markdown_heading` values must match the corresponding h2 headings in your markdown resume file.



## Job Sub Sections 💼

Within job entries (particularly in the Experience section), various subsections can be used to structure your information. These are defined by the `JobSubsection` enum which maps markdown elements to properly formatted document sections. The **Markdown headings are *case-insensitive***. The default mappings are:

| Markdown Element | Markdown Heading | Word Document Heading | Notes |
|------------------|--------------|---------------------|-------|
| h3 | highlights | Highlights | Used in the About section for key achievements |
| h5 | key skills | Technical Skills | Lists skills relevant to a specific role |
| h5 | summary | Summary | Brief overview of a position |
| h5 | internal | Internal | Internal project/responsibilities |
| h5 | project/client | Project/Client | Client project details |
| h6 | responsibilities overview | Responsibilities: | Project responsibilities |
| h6 | additional details | Additional Details: | Supplementary information |

These subsections help structure your job entries in a way that makes them more readable to both humans and ATS systems. For example, under each job, you might include a "Key Skills" subsection to highlight relevant technologies and abilities specific to that role.



## Configuration ⚙️

Two configuration files are used to control the look of the final document, and to a limited degree, functionality.

### Resume Style Configuration

Use the [resume configuration file](./src/resume_config.yaml) to control the [*look and feel*](#styling-) of the final document.

### API Configuration

Use the [api configuration file](./src/api_config.yaml) (`api_config.yaml`) to control the [API](#-api-usage-) behevior.



## ✨ API Usage 🌀

The project includes a REST API that converts markdown resumes to ATS-friendly formats (DOCX and PDF). This allows you to integrate the conversion functionality into other applications or workflows.

> [!NOTE]
> To run the API locally, see [Starting the API Server Locally](#starting-the-api-server-locally-).

### API Endpoints 🎸

1. #### Convert to DOCX 🦋

    Converts a markdown resume to DOCX format:

    ```
    POST /convert/docx
    POST /convert/docx/{filename}
    ```

    ##### Support 🪜

    | API | Supported |
    |-----|:---------:|
    | **Local** | ✅ |
    | **AWS** | ✅ |

1. #### Convert to PDF 🦋

    Converts a markdown resume to PDF format:

    ```
    POST /convert/pdf
    POST /convert/pdf/{filename}
    ```

    ##### Support 🪜

    | API | Supported |
    |-----|:---------:|
    | **Local** | ✅ |
    | **AWS** | ❌ |

#### Request Parameters ⚙️

| Parameter | Description | Required |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| `input_file` | Markdown resume file to convert | Yes |
| `config_options` | JSON string with configuration overrides | No |

#### AWS API Examples ☁️

The AWS (*Amazon Web Services*) implementation doesn't currently support file inputs, so the `--data` parameter (`-d`) is used for the resume payload.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> AWS access currently requires an API key

##### Remote Conversion to DOCX 🦋

The following command demonstrates basic API use.

```bash
curl -X POST "https://7lm0a3cnti.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/convert/docx" \
  -H "x-api-key: ${API_KEY}" \
  -H "Accept: application/octet-stream" \
  -d "$(cat path/to/resume.md)" -o resume.docx
```

##### Remote Convert with Custom Configuration 🦋

This following example also demonstrates the possibility of running the `curl` statement by pasting the resume markdown contents directly in the command (between beginnig `'EOT'` and ending `EOT`):

```bash
curl -X POST "https://7lm0a3cnti.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/convert/docx" \
  -H "x-api-key: ${API_KEY}" \
  -H "Accept: application/octet-stream" \
  -F "config_options={\"style_constants\": {\"paragraph_lists\": false} \
  -d "$(cat <<'EOT'
...resume markdown contents...
EOT
)" -o resume.docx
```

> [!NOTE]
> - The url (specifically, the `7lm0a3cnti` part) is subject to change
> - The mimetype `application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document` will also work in the `Accept` header, e.g. `-H Accept: application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document`

> [!TIP]
> - The `--data` (`-d`) parameter can also be used for local API requests (see the [Local Examples](#local-examples-), below)
> - If `input_file` and request data (`-d`) are both used, the input file will take precedence. This preference is configured in [`api_config.yaml`](./src/api_config.yaml) as the `input.prefer_file` boolean setting (currently set to `true`)

##### AWS Serverless 🛸

This project uses [**Serverless**](https://www.serverless.com/) and [**serverless-wsgi**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serverless-wsgi) to accomplish running a serverless API in [ApiGateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/) that triggers an AWS [Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/pm/lambda/) (the python api).



## Local Usage 👾

### Initial Setup 📀

> [!NOTE]
> *Your system needs to satisfy the [**system requirements**](#system-requirements-)*

The setup process involves running only 2 commands:

1. The `make` command creates any necessary pre-requisite files or directories, including creating a *virtual environment*, and ensuring [`pip`](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) is installed and in your PATH.
1. The `make install` command installs any required dependencies.

> [!WARNING]
> Although not strictly necessary, creating and [activating](#activation-️) a *virtual environment* is the **recommended** approach for most users. It causes the dependecies to be installed locally to this project, and not globally.

They can be run as separate commands, or as a single command, with the second dependent on the success of the first:

```bash
# Run as separate commands:
make
make install

# Run as a single command:
make && make install
```

> [!NOTE]
> See the [Basic Commands](#basic-commands-%EF%B8%8F) section for more commands.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> #### 🗒 Note about the `python` command
> Most of the commands in the [usage section](#local-usage-) assume [activation of a *virtual environment*](#activation-️), which, if created using the approach in this project (created with *python*) creates a `python` command alias. If you used an alternate setup approach and the `python` command isn't working, try `python3` instead. Or simply create an alias: **`alias python='python3'`**


### Activation 🕹️

🌐 **Remember to *activate* the virtual environment *before* running any Python commands** 🌐

```bash
. .venv/bin/activate
```

> [!TIP]
> Run `deactivate` to deactivate the *virtual environment*.



### Python Usage 🐍

📘 **Convert your Markdown resume to a Word document (`.docx`)** 📘

*Please make sure the [Initial Setup](#initial-setup-) has been completed.*

> [!TIP]
> The help screen can be accessed by running the following:
> ```bash
> python src/resume_md_to_docx.py -h
> ```

> [!TIP]
> Spaces in file names can be escaped with a backslash (`\`), e.g. `path/to/my\ resume.md`

### Basic usage 🍰

By default, the name of the output file will match that of the input file, but with the appropriate extension. The **output files** will be in the project's [`output/`](./output/) directory unless other specified (with the `-o` or `--output` option).

#### ✨ Interactive mode 📱

By default, the command with no options or arguments, will cause the script to run in **interactive mode**, prompting the user (you) for inputs:

```bash
python src/resume_md_to_docx.py
```

#### Manual mode 🎛

Run in manual mode, specifying an input file:


```bash
# This will create a file called "resume.docx" in
# the "data/" directory, i.e. "data/resume.docx"
python src/resume_md_to_docx.py -i resume.md
```

Specify an output filename:

```bash
python src/resume_md_to_docx.py -i sample/example/example.md -o ~/Desktop/example\ ats\ resume.docx
```

> [!NOTE]
> If a `python: command not found` error occurs, see the [important note about the python command](#-note-about-the-python-command), in the usage section.


### ✨ Produce a PDF 📕

Adding `--pdf` to any of the above commands will also produce a `.pdf` file in the same directory as the `.docx` file (this will be the project's [`output/`](./output/) directory if the *output* option isn't set):

```bash
# This will create 2 files: "sample/example/output/example.docx" and "sample/example/output/example.pdf"
python src/resume_md_to_docx.py -i sample/example/example.md --pdf
```

> [!NOTE]
> The `--pdf` option isn't needed if running in *interactive mode*.


### All Options ⚙️

| Option | Long Form | Description | Default |
|--------|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `-c` | `--config` | Path to YAML configuration file | `resume_config.yaml` |
| `-h` | `--help` | Access the help screen | |
| `-i` | `--input` | Input markdown file | None (required in non-interactive mode) |
| `-o` | `--output` | Output Word document | `<input_file>.docx` in the output directory |
| `-I` | `--interactive` | Run in interactive mode, prompting for inputs | Auto-enabled when no other args provided |
| `-P` | `--pdf` | Also create a PDF version of the resume | Disabled |

#### Examples 🤖

```bash
# Set input, output, and create a pdf
python src/resume_md_to_docx.py -i sample/example/example.md -o ~/Desktop/example\ ats\ resume.docx --pdf

# Set input, output, create a pdf, and use a custom configuration file
python src/resume_md_to_docx.py -i sample/example/example.md -o ~/Desktop/example\ ats\ resume.docx --pdf -c custom_config.yaml
```


### Starting the API Server Locally 🚆

By default, the server runs on `localhost:3000`. This is set in the [`api_config.yaml`](./src/api_config.yaml) file.

**To start the API server**

```bash
# Using the make command
make api

# Or run directly
python -m src.api
```

#### Local Examples 🤖

##### Basic Conversion to DOCX 🦋

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:3000/convert/docx" \
  -F "input_file=@resume.md" \
  -o resume_ats.docx
```

##### Convert with Custom Configuration 🦋

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:3000/convert/pdf" \
  -F "input_file=@resume.md" \
  -F "config_options={\"style_constants\": {\"paragraph_lists\": true}, {\"Subtitle\": {\"font_name\": "Helvetica Neue"}}}" \
  -o resume_ats.pdf
```

#### Swagger UI 🌊

The API includes Swagger documentation accessible at:

```
http://localhost:3000/swagger
```

This provides an interactive interface to:
- View all available endpoints
- Test API operations directly from the browser
- See detailed parameter and response documentation
